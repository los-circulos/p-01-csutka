### Csutka (choot-kah) 

## Original Csutka.svg

Original "Csutka" designed and drawn by Istvan Travnik. 49" wingspan, .40 size engine, ~1200g. Redrawn in SVG 2022 los.circulos

## Adapted Csutka23

"Csutka23" is a smaller, ~90% adaptation designed for .25FP/LA or .25FX engines and laser cutting. With 44" wingspan and 850-1000g dry weight.

Some 3d printable support pieces can be found in my other https://github.com/los-circulos/k-02-rib-guides git repository - jig pieces for wing building and profiling tools for LE and TE. You can also print your bellcarnk (see below).

### 2 options for:

#### Fuselage:
 - standard "racer" fuselage and landing gear serves for asphalt
 - "jet" fuselage has a slimmer tail, and offers a reduced single wheel landing gear. Serves for hand launch and landing on grass. Can be cut from standard fuselage/tail pieces, with the optional bottom skid.

#### Bellcrank mount:
 - "JR" option for 2mm thick aluminium (or similar) bellcrank (3")
 - "PRO" option for 8mm nylon (or similar) bellcrank (see my other https://github.com/los-circulos/k-09-bellcranks git repository) - also apt for bellcrank with built in expo (3")

#### Control system:
 - "JR" a custom lightweight solution (requires fabrication)
 - "PRO" option for RC control pieces

#### Cable leadouts
 - "JR" adjustable option for displacable leadout guide tubes, pre-cut holes in the closing rib
 - "PRO" adjustable option the usual sliding-piece-with-tubes-held-by-bolt solution

#### Engine position
 - engine can be installed in a forward position, for initial fly-in or for beginners
 - engine installed in normal position should give a good CG balance (highly depends on finishing)

### Foldable landing gear
 - allows folding the landing gear under the fuel tank and engine
 - suits engines with no / small muffler

### Adjustable rudder (optional)

Look for layer names, they contain piece numbers and material.

Laser cut sheets are available on request.
